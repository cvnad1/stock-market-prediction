prediction of stock points using LSTM
The given files depict the basic functioning and redefining of datset of a single feature and modifying it to a dataset of features and labelling it automatically. It also covers 
the explanation of lstm inputs and training and also predicting the values using most important libraries of deep learning.Overall,it is a good example to illustrate the power of 
Lstm.The user can use his own dataset to change the code at respective code lines to work it out.
